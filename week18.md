With advances in surveillance and communications technology, we can now collect a wide range of data on a large scale that can be used to develop artificial intelligence systems to help predict and prevent crime. Designing a "stupid" AI system that can accurately predict premeditated deadly crimes by analyzing data from all surveillance cameras and electronic communications around the world could have many benefits and implications.

First, a "stupid" AI is a machine learning system that does not truly understand human behavior or language. Such systems are capable of performing specified tasks, but do not have the ability to think or reason autonomously. In contrast, a highly intelligent system can understand language and human behavior and think and reason autonomously.

The potential benefit of a "dumb" AI system is that it can process large amounts of data and automate surveillance processes to effectively predict and prevent criminal behavior. This could help law enforcement agencies to better plan and allocate resources and improve the efficiency of crime detection and prevention, thereby reducing crime rates. In addition, such systems can improve public safety and provide greater public peace of mind.

However, there are some disadvantages to such a system, including the potential for bias and error, and the potential for privacy violations. Since the system would be monitoring a large number of people, it could have an adverse effect on people's privacy. If the system incorrectly identifies criminal suspects, or incorrectly considers innocent people as suspects, it would result in unnecessary fright and humiliation of innocent people.

Developing such a system would challenge our assumptions about intelligence and agency, as it might overturn our past belief that only highly intelligent machines can perform similar tasks. Such a system might prove that machines can provide very valuable services even in the absence of intelligence. It would also prompt us to re-examine our expectations and limitations of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

In developing a "stupid" AI system, we need to consider ethical factors such as privacy protection and fairness. Such systems may collect large amounts of personal data, which can lead to violations of individual privacy. Therefore, there is a need to ensure that the system complies with privacy protection laws and ethical guidelines.
