I find it interesting that the opening paragraph depicts a girl imitating a performer on TV, who represents a symbol of admiration. I believe that humans instinctively crave for such superhuman beings, or are attracted to the forms of superhumanity, which are strange, different, and astonishing. I think that in the significant transition from superhumanity to posthumanity, one point is essential, which is Wells' theory of "escape from the biological matrix" as an element of posthumanity. By shedding the original objects, I believe the concept of cyborgs is crucial because cyborgs themselves are a form of superhumanism that helps humans adapt to the external environment. In almost every science fiction work, when human technology is extremely developed, people will inevitably pursue the limits of human bodies and transform themselves to gain more extensive and broader worlds.

In the middle, when many "police" came to arrest the girl. People in the secular sense cannot understand this transhumanism, especially after the era of humanism. It is clear that the dominant view of this era was human-centered, and the definition of humanity was still limited to the human body. It was considered foolish to cut off one's own legs in exchange for a more powerful machine. As humans become increasingly technological, there will certainly be debates about whether "technology can replace humans" or "technology cannot replace humans". The former leads to a disembodied posthumanism, while the latter leads to an embodied posthumanism. I think MV reflects a disembodied posthumanism. It is more like a belief that the body is only a secondary attachment to life, and that the most important vehicle of life is not in the body itself, but in the sensory information that encodes the information. However, the secular sense that people are often embodied actually seems to be more in line with the common sense perception of many people.

In the end of the MV, even the legs have completely departed from the shape of legs and become sharp and aggressive. I don't think it has reached the concept of post-humanism, but it is still an art of transhumanism. To become a true post-humanist, it must weaken the concept of subjectivity and abandon the concept of human beings. Wolf once tried to reimagine the concept of subjectivity as something that is not limited to human beings, in order to answer what post-humanism is. For example, if a person changes all of their parts except for the brain through electronic modification, and even further stores the brain in binary code in a computer, what is their existence? That may not be born different from others, but it is a choice of challenge and adventure. 
> As Nietzsche said, 'When thinking and analyzing, one cannot help but start from one's own standpoint and perspective, and cannot transcend one's own standpoint and perspective.' 

Perhaps only when the brain is purely informational and the body is mechanical, can we completely abandon the concept of human beings.
