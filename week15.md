I will present my thoughts on the works in the exhibition on a question-by-question basis. Since 1949, New Contemporaries has been supporting the next generation of artists to ensure the long-term sustainability of emerging practices, and Rosalie Wammes' work is interesting because I heard an odd sound as I entered the hall, which I thought was a kind of music in the hall, and I was looking for the source as I visited the exhibition, and of course because this I was looking for the source as I visited the exhibition, but of course, because this ceramic oddity was so conspicuous, I quickly pinpointed it, and I searched hard for the source but couldn't find it. Two huge clay structures - like giant ear canals combined with a pottery amplifier sort of like one - came out of the mouth with noise that was deeply organic, human, but also disturbingly alien. I feel a bit like a repressed emotion, but at the same time after listening to it for a long time I feel a bit lost in it, and I think the author should be trying to convey an inexact emotion, but I'm not sure. I think it lacks some computerization in itself, both in the materials chosen and the way it is expressed, it seems rather simple. I chose it because it is weird, even the form is a bit ugly in my mind, and I appreciate some strange installations that will make me feel interesting.

This is artist Chiharu Shiota's first exhibition project with Blain Southern - "Journey to the Unknown" shiota is mainly known for her immersive installation design, a dense web of red yarn that looks like it is spreading from the roof to the skeleton of a boat and the ground. The blood-red yarn ties suggest the intricate neurological connections within the human body and brain, inspiring thoughts of existence, fate, and belonging, and evoking ideas as complex as the tangled web of yarn. I think the forms of expression are very similar, but the ear works themselves have a modern technology attached to them, namely a loudspeaker, which I think is an interesting combination of something traditional and a more emerging technology. It's a more stream-of-consciousness feeling to express this kind of thinking. I think this work could actually be more like this if it were possible.

I think that each artist's own way of thinking and seeing the world makes up the difference in their artwork.

I think there is, that is, I think more deeply about the installation, and the installation can be an object that conveys feelings. I think if it were this work, maybe I would prefer the sound set by the ear to the ear itself, which is more associative.
