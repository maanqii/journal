## Minus: https://minus.social/
One low-tech example in the class was the MINUS website, a site that I signed up for and where everyone can post a hundred messages. However, I do not think it is particularly meaningful. Yes, it is not built to handle a high amount of traffic, meaning that its purpose is to facilitate better communication. But first of all, each person can only send a hundred messages, which forces people to choose more carefully. It seems to be a reaction to dissatisfaction with social media platforms like Facebook. The sustainability of the site is also questionable, and in general, people are seeking long-term, stable relationships, both online and offline.

If the goal is to go back to basics and limit the number of posts a user can make, then users may be more likely to post random content, briefly experience the site, and then leave. This is because the site lacks something to attract them. The website itself may be clean, but the users themselves are not. I am forced to see slurs from some users, which is something that I find hard to reconcile with big data. Obviously, not everyone is spreading love and hope calmly, especially when they feel they have only a few days left to make their mark. Many people exhibit cranky and destructive behavior instead.

Social networking sites are considered to be attention-grabbing, and they have a unique fascination that can only be achieved by assembling a considerable amount of human and material resources."

## Low-tech Lab: https://wiki.lowtechlab.org/wiki/Group:Low-tech_Lab
The majority of projects on this website help me to better understand the concept of low technology. Interestingly, one of the reasons for this is that I feel low technology is a behavior that serves the needs of high-level humans because it is about what they create. Whether it's the website I mentioned earlier or the ovens and dryers that people create using low technology, it made me reflect on whether this is a form of arrogance and prejudice exclusive to wealthy or resource-rich people in developed countries.

In fact, rural poverty-stricken populations, such as some rural areas in China that I used as an example, naturally exist with low technology because there is no influx of high technology. In fact, capital cannot even penetrate these areas. Even online shopping vendors are reluctant to deliver to these areas due to the vast and remote geography, which is a loss-making proposition.

In the websites I have viewed, I think that low technology is more of a personal pleasure in handmade crafts from the perspective of developing countries, rather than a means of improving the quality of life in impoverished areas. However, there is a certain difference between low technology and primitive technology. Low technology is a technology with technical content, and its original intention is to promote environmental protection and sustainability. I believe this is reasonable and effective. When technology is transferred to impoverished areas, it is a form of knowledge transfer, as people in impoverished areas can improve on existing technology, although environmental protection obviously exceeds the requirements of the cognitive level of impoverished populations."

As the media hammer on about the doom and gloom of climate change, it turns out that housing is the most energy-consuming sector (43%) in France and one of the main greenhouse gas emitters (17%). But it is also an excellent way for more and more people who are looking for solutions to start their transition!
So, on board a van-come-workshop-on-wheels, the Low-tech Lab team hit the roads of France to meet those* who made their ideas of more sustainable living come true!

Perhaps one of the implications of low technology is to allow developed countries and wealthy people to be environmentally friendly while improving the living conditions of poor areas.
