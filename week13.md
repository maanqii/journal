When I came to this exhibition, I felt that the overall atmosphere was not so much beautiful and gorgeous as it was a very strange, even depressing feeling in the heart.

Since my undergraduate degree is in product design, this made me relatively familiar with this exhibition. I think I had heard a lot of praise for these works in my undergraduate years, and I was actually in a different state of mind when I had the privilege of seeing the actual exhibits, especially after learning about the meaning of these works, which I think has helped me make more progress in understanding the works.
What was particularly impressive was that

I have to say that the surrealism of Objects of Desire was very inspiring. I think it's reasonable to say that I don't think it's more aesthetically pleasing in itself, something that was relatively ahead of its time, and I think it's more of a formal innovation than an aesthetic focus. Of course, light can also be beautiful, for example

Gaetano Pesce's La Mamma
The Italian architect and designer's iconic foam chair "La Mamma" represents a female figure holding a ball, symbolizing the weight of centuries of male prejudice, which saw women as prisoners. Although it initially looks curvaceous and comfortable, the act of sitting in this chair is compelling. It reminds me of a runway show I watched earlier, where models displayed people on their backs in this way, which I thought was a wonderful way to express ideas. It's a symbolic approach. It was amazing that I had seen the same chair in SOHO center in China, maybe a pirated version, and sat on it with great interest without knowing its meaning. I think this is also a manifestation of power indifference, not even being able to sympathize and reflect on oneself, because one is in a state of superiority and thoughtlessness, which is a kind of lack of declarative knowledge.

As a surrealist exhibition, I will try to present the artifacts and spaces in unique, bizarre and extraordinary ways that resonate with the imagination and emotions of the viewers. The following are ways I might consider displaying them.
Use of light and shadow effects: Using lighting, projection and other techniques to create a mesmerizing surrealist atmosphere that will make the viewer feel like they are walking in a supernatural world.
Environmental installations: Using modern technology and design techniques to create a surrealistic spatial atmosphere, such as suspended sculptures, mazes, mirrors, etc.

Holistic display: Matching different artifacts with each other to create a peculiar visual impact effect, allowing the audience to feel the charm of surrealism.
In choosing artifacts, I will select objects that are interesting, mysterious, extraordinary, and make people feel surprised and psychedelic. These artifacts should echo the atmosphere of surrealism and can evoke emotional resonance in the viewer. For example, I might choose to display some ancient religious idols, alien artifacts, pop culture objects, etc.

At the same time, I would also abandon some artifacts, such as those that are too common and lack emotional and aesthetic value. I believe that in a surrealist exhibition, it is important to choose artifacts that evoke the viewer's emotions and imagination, rather than objects that are common and universal.
