# coding literacy
## Part I
When the first car hit the streets, I'm sure no one thought it would become a vehicle used by almost everyone. In the same way, programming is slowly moving from being a vocational skill for a few people to a popular one in an era where the Internet age has opened up and become widespread.
Programming, as the name implies, is the process of having a computer write a program code in a programming language to solve a problem and eventually get the corresponding result, in short, programming is a language in which humans and computers talk.
There are many problems that are different between those who can code and those who cannot. For example, we recently planned to travel to France and we had to apply for a Schengen visa. If I could code, maybe I could ask the program to check if there are any tickets left for me at regular intervals, while I use the time to work, go to class, watch a movie or go shopping. Instead of sitting in front of the computer and wasting a morning swiping tickets.
I think the reason for the emergence of programming is to free people from the repetition of complicated things, because computers are the best at long and repetitive work, programming is ultimately written to solve problems, and learning to program is the same as mastering the ability to read and write in the information age. Language is a basis for the composition of human society, and programming is the basis for the formation of the Internet. When ChatGPT, AI painting and the like enter the public eye, and these are likely to have a huge impact on the entire development of humanity, people are born in this era. And the foundation of all this is built on programming, a skill that still seems somewhat esoteric and boring in the present.

> The bar for programming used to be much higher - requiring access to expensive mainframes, training programs or a background in math or engineering. But now, with ubiquitous computing devices and free online courses, learning to program has become much easier.

I was inspired by this statement a lot, because programming is obviously a very difficult hurdle in terms of equipment before it becomes a basic literacy, and obviously in developing countries computers are an out-of-reach existence for people in mountainous areas, and of course due to the success of literacy campaigns due to the declining cost of paper and pens, I think computers may be inherently different from them, and certainly possible to achieve.

> That is, a language should have a low barrier to entry (low floor), leave a lot of room for proficiency (high ceiling), make room for diverse applications (wide walls), and enable people to share their stuff to write (open windows).

Even though there is a lot of press about how primary and secondary school students can use code to make their own inventions, code is still a difficult thing for most people to understand, and no matter what kind of code it is, it lacks a low barrier to entry. python may be a typical low barrier application, but my mother still encountered many obstacles when she went to learn to use it. On top of being difficult to understand, the resources for the course were a mixed bag, and she would go on video sites to find some explanations, but the fact that many people don't teach it uniformly, as well as not knowing much about English themselves due to being non-English speakers, made it much harder to get started. But programming does have a lot of room for growth and can do a lot of things, for example the numpy app for python does have her unique ability to make tables.

> Can you explain to me how Michael Bloomberg could do a better job in his day-to-day leadership? If he woke up one morning as a good Java coder, would he be the biggest city in America?" 

In fact, before thinking about this, I think it's more interesting to explore the order of the web when the whole population can program - it's even tied to the order of reality. For example, when text is popular, obviously now textual opinion is a form of self-expression for people so far. Then programming can also be, when people's programming literacy is generally improved, the solidity of the system will become uncertain, and perhaps more professionals are needed to maintain it - perhaps this also indirectly creates more jobs, but obviously security becomes a new social problem.
