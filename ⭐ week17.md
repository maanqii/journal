## Minus: https://minus.social/
A low-tech example from class is the MINUS website, which I signed up for and on which each person can post a hundred messages. Its purpose is to return to what the site was built for in the first place: to promote better communication among people. First of all, it was not built for the pursuit of traffic, which means that each person can only post one hundred messages, which forces people to choose more carefully. This seems to be an antagonistic stance against the incessant expansion of social media platforms like Facebook in search of "more". However, I think there's a lot to be said for the fact that, as an experimental site, it doesn't consider sustainability. But as a result, other products like this site can be questioned as to their ability to supply people's needs over time. In general, people seek long-term, stable relationships, whether online or offline.
If the goal is to return to the nature of the site, by limiting the number of posts users can make, I don't think there will be a very good feedback. Users may be more inclined to post random content, experience the site briefly, and then leave. This is because the site lacks something to attract them. The site itself may be clean, but the quality of users varies. I am forced to see slurs from some users, something that I find hard to reconcile with big data. Obviously, not everyone wants to spread some love and hope, especially when they feel like they only have one chance left to do their own thing and make their own arguments. Many instead exhibit cranky and destructive behavior. Modern social networking sites are considered eye-catching and monsters that occupy a lot of wasted people's time, but the high quality output formed by a large number of users is something that is hard to achieve with this site and can only be achieved by assembling a considerable amount of human and material resources.

## Low-tech Lab: https://wiki.lowtechlab.org/wiki/Group:Low-tech_Lab
Most of the projects on this site helped me better understand the concept of low-tech. Interestingly, at the very beginning, it even gave me the impression that low-tech is a technology that serves the needs of people who have capital because of the things they create. In the site, people use ovens and dryers created by low-tech. Is this a form of arrogance and prejudice that is unique to the rich or resourceful in the developed world. The fact is that the rural poor, and I'll give some examples of rural areas in China, are naturally low-tech because there is no influx of high technology. In fact, capital cannot even penetrate these areas. Even with online shopping, merchants are reluctant to deliver to these areas because they are vast and remote, and merchants are not willing to make money-losing deals.
Of the sites I have visited, low-tech seems to be more about personal pleasure in handcrafting than a means to improve the quality of life in poor areas. However, there is a difference between low-tech and primitive technology. Low-tech is a technology that has a technical content and was originally intended to promote environmental protection and sustainable development. I think it is reasonable and effective. When technology is transferred to poor areas, it is a transfer of knowledge (science) because people in poor areas can improve on existing technology. And environmental protection clearly exceeds the requirements of the poor people's cognitive level.

> "As the media hammer on about the doom and gloom of climate change, it turns out that housing is the most energy-consuming sector (43%) in France and one of the main greenhouse gas emitters (17%). But it is also an excellent way for more and more people who are looking for solutions to start their transition! So, on board a van-come-workshop-on-wheels, the Low-tech Lab team hit the roads of France to meet those* who made their ideas of more sustainable living come true!"

Perhaps one of the implications of low technology is to allow developed countries and wealthy people to be environmentally friendly while improving the living conditions of poor areas.
