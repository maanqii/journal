In the depths of the universe, a huge space station shining with blue and green light floats quietly. This space station is the latest masterpiece of human civilization.

This space station uses the most advanced technology, extracting unlimited energy from the universe to maintain the station. Robots are everywhere, using their own robotic arms for maintenance and construction. The human crew sits inside the station, controlling the entire operation, and they never feel alone because their robot companions are always by their side.

The crew of this space station is not chosen at random, they are the best of the best, not only scientists and technologists, but also artists, writers and poets, disabled and modified people. The process looks not only at technical ability, but also at the emotional and spiritual qualities of the individual. Crew members had to undergo a series of tests, which included tests of survivability in prolonged solitary situations, tests of emotional stability and tests of creativity.

One of the best crew members on the space station is a scientist named Lucy. She studies the emotional connection between robots and humans, and she has a strong bond with her robot companion "Bobo". This is because in a mission, her robot companion saved her life, and since then their relationship has become closer and closer.

But in an unexpected incident, Lucy was tragically killed. The entire space station was plunged into a great sadness, everyone was shaken by her departure. The robot companion "Bobo" also felt the loss, their emotions were broken by this sudden parting.

However, the robots of the station are different, they have emotions and can understand and empathize with human grief. The robots began to organize an event to honor Jessica, and the crew joined in, singing, writing poems, and reminiscing together about her life and accomplishments. The event became one of the best moments on the space station, and the emotional connection between humans and robots became even stronger.
